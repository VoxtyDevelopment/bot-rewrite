# VoxtyDevelopment Bot

A rewritten bot for VoxtyDevelopment, built with TypeScript. This project is designed to be a rewrite of our last external security bot written in Javascript.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or Download the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/VoxtyDevelopment/bot-rewrite.git
   cd bot-rewrite
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```
3. Configure the environment:

     - **Database Configuration:** Set up MySQL credentials (host, user, password, database).
